      "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \n",

      "driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change \n",
      "Greenhouse Gases \n",
      "The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \n",
      "atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \n",
      "oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is essential \n",
      "for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \n",
      "activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. Fossil Fuels \n",
      "Burning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \n",
      "natural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \n",

      "source of CO2 emissions. Despite a decline in some regions, coal remains a significant \n",
      "energy source globally. It is mined extensively in countries like China, India, and the United \n",
      "States, contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints. Oil \n",
      "Oil is used primarily for transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The combustion of \n",
      "oil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate \n",
      "change and air quality issues. The global oil industry is vast, involving extraction, refining, \n",
      "and distribution, with significant geopolitical and economic implications. Natural Gas \n",
      "Natural gas is the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a \"bridge fuel\" to a \n",
