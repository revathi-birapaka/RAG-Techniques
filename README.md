# RAG-Techniques
I have been actively exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to strengthen the performance of large language models by combining them with external knowledge sources. RAG provides a powerful way to overcome the limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinations and outdated information, by retrieving relevant context before generating responses. Through this learning, I gained a deeper understanding of the complete workflow—ranging from document indexing and embeddings to retrieval strategies and response generation. A significant part of this journey has been supported by NirDiamant’s GitHub resources, where his tutorials offered practical insights into implementing and optimizing RAG pipelines for real-world applications requiring accuracy, reliability, and domain specificity.
